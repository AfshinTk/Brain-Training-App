# Brain Training App

A lightweight, interactive brain-training application built with Streamlit.  
This project is a digital implementation of simple daily brain-training exercises inspired by Dr Ryuta Kawashima’s work on maintaining and improving cognitive function through simple arithmetic test. Rather than using a paper workbook, this tool provides interactive exercises, timing, and progress tracking.

## Motivation & Background  
Dr Ryuta Kawashima’s research at Tohoku University demonstrates that engaging the prefrontal cortex through reading aloud, simple calculations and memory tasks can help maintain brain health and slow cognitive decline. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
The aim of this project is to take those principles and create a practical digital application for daily use.
